Assignment Question
```

# Single Page Application

## ISYS 3004 Assignment 1 v 1. 0

## Due: 23 : 59 , Friday 15 April 2022

## Introduction

The main components of web development are HTML, CSS, and
Javascript, which make up all of the sites and pages we visit today.
Each element is in charge of a different aspect of how a page appears
in your browser. You don’t need all three to construct a website, but
having them all helps.
A Single Page Application (SPA) never refreshes. The browser
retrieves all necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a one-page load
in a SPA. The content of a SPA can dynamically update content 1 , but
the page never refreshes. Once loaded, a SPA makes the website feel
more like a native app.

## The Task

You will convert the ISYS 3004 Unit Outline to a SPA.

- using HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- apply styles using CSS
- create themes using CSS
- add support for switching between themes using JavaScript
- deploy the SPA live on the internet

You can use code snippets and templates from forums and web-
sites, ff you acknowledge the source. But you CAN NOT use site
generators, 3 rd party CSS, front-end frameworks or site build tools.
A good submission usevanillaHTML, CSS, JavaScript, conform
to theBusiness Web Technologies Style Guide, and demonstrate the
conceptSeparation of Concerns. If you can’t do this, you will need to
include a comment on why it does not conform to the guidelines in
the appropriate file.
You will deploy the site live to Netlify or GitHub pages and will
provide a link at the time of submission. You may need to create an
account on either site. The free account plan will be sufficient for this
assignment.
The SPA should be error-free based on the official HTML 5 speci-
fications via W 3 C HTML Validator and CSS validation via W 3 C CSS
Validator. If you cannot resolve the errors, please include a comment
in the appropriate file identifying the error and cross-reference in the
README file.
The SPA should be responsive and meet accepted World Wide
Web Consortium’s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Version 2. 0.
Please include a comment in the appropriate file and cross-reference
in the README if this is not possible.
Each submission shall also include a README file that describes
the work. The README is either in plain text (README.txt) or
Markdown (README.md). We will not mark other formats. Please
use all capital letters for README. The contents should include:

- Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly imple-
    mented and what have not.
- Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed
    the assignment.
- Include how many hours you have spent completing the assign-
    ment.
